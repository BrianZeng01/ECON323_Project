## Project Inspiration

I've recently discovered that I suffer from sleep apnea, a debilatating sleeping disorder. After seeing a specialist and learning about all the consequences of poor sleep, I've been inspired to explore patterns in sleep and their relations to negative symptons. 

## Data
Data Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laavanya/human-stress-detection-in-and-through-sleep?select=SaYoPillow.csv)
<br>
With the lack of sleep apnea datasets, we will be utilizing a dataset from a sleep study with various sleep stats, one of the important ones being stress. One symptom of sleep apnea is high stress so this is a good compromise, though our project makes no point in claiming any sort of casuality. 

## Rough Project Outline
1. An introduction of ourselves and the aim our of project, which is predicting stress levels given various sleeping features.
2. Examine our dataset and see if any pre-processing or cleaning needs to be done.
3. Take a look at many different approaches for our model like multi-class regressions, clustering, decision trees etc.
4. Then we will train a model on 80-90% of this dataset and use the rest for a test set. 
5. We will be sure to adhere to machine learning principles such as the bedrock principle, optimization bias, etc. 
6. Present our results and interpretations numerically/visually (eg. training visualizations). 
7. Discussion about the shortcomings of our model and/or experimentation process.

## Work Distribution
We have agreed that the most efficient way for us to collaborate is to work synchronously rather than splitting things up task by task. Some benefits we discussed include...

1. Instant feedback about ideas or issues we are running into, less blockers
2. Exposure to all parts of the project and greater learning
3. Always on the same page
4. No need to stitch solutions our parts together which may be more time consuming
