I've recently discovered that I suffer from sleep apnea, a debilatating sleeping disorder. After seeing a specialist and learning about all the consequences of poor sleep, I've been inspired to explore patterns in sleep and their relations to negative symptons. With the lack of sleep apnea datasets, we will be utilizing a dataset from a sleep study with various sleep stats, one of the important ones being stress. One symptom of sleep apnea is high stress so this is a good compromise, though makes no point in claiming any sort of casuality. 

First we will examine our dataset and see if any pre-processing or cleaning needs to be done. Then we will train a model on 80-90% of this dataset and use the rest for a test set. To build our model we will take a look at many different approaches like multi-class regressions, clustering, decision trees etc. We will be sure to adhere to machine learning principles such as the bedrock principle, optimization bias, etc. We will then present our results numerically and visually (likely training visualizations). Lastly a discussion about the shortcomings of our model and/or experimentation process.
